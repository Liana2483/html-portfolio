<h1>Liana's favorite movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Hidden figues</h3>
<p>It's a great movie about the course of life of 3 black women, that work in nasa - based on a real life story, gets me to tears each time</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>A dystopian movie in regards the end of the world that involves sci-fi and space, seems like I have a theme here, also an extremely emotional watch for me</p>
<h3>Guardians of the galaxy</h3>
<p>I did cry in guardians III but this one was just epic in anyway, funny as hell</p>
